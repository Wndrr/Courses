# Accumulation of change introduction

With a function defined as $y = f(x)$, we want to find the area of the zone below the curve, above the $x$ axis and between $a$ and $b$

Without calculus, we could get better and better approximation by dividing the area into smaller areas that can be calculated using algebra. For example we could divide the area into rectangles such that $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n f(x_i)\Delta x_i$ This is the Reimann sum approximation. As long as we use a finite number, this result will remain an approximation. The smaller $\Delta x_i$ is and the closer to infinity $x$ gets, the closer to reality. This is the core idea of integral calculus, when $n \to \infty$.

It is called integral calculus because the centre idea of this field is the integral $\int$. For example, the integral notation for the above approximation is 
$$
\int\limits_a^b f(x) dx
$$
It is connected to the notion of derivative, in fact that of an anti-derivative.

# Definite integrals intro

The power of the definite integral come into play when trying to determine the area under a curve. $\int\limits_a^bf(x)dx$ represents the area under the curve $f(x)$ and between $x=a$ and $x=b$
