# Introduction of the atom

Chemistry is the study of the building block of the universe.

Mathematics, is the pure language of the universe.

Physics is the description of the structure of reality.

Chemistry is closely related to physics is the study of how physics and math assemble turn into the building blocks of our universe.

On top of chemistry, is biology. All four of these fields are interconnected and bleed into each other.

This is the root stack of all other sciences.

# Definition of an element

A chemical element, also called simply element, is any substance that cannot be decomposed into simpler substances by ordinary chemical processes. Elements are considered the basic building blocks that all matter is made of.

# An idea of the size of a single atom

The width of a single human hair for example is on average $1\times10^6$ atoms. 

# Definition of an element

The nucleus of an atom is made of protons and neutrons. An element is defined by the number of protons. The number of neutrons and electrons can change and the atom will still be the same element. A different number of protons makes a new element.

The notation $\ce{^12_6C}$ stands for "carbon 12". It states that the nucleus is composed of 12 "entities", of which 6 has to be protons (otherwise it wouldn't be carbon) and so 6 neutrons, for a total of 12. An other example is carbon 14 $\ce{^14_6C}$, with 6 protons and 8 neutrons.

An element is called neutral if it has as many electrons as protons. In the example of carbon, with 6 protons, it would be neutral in the electric charge sense with 6 electrons. $0 = 6p^+ + 6e_-$.

## Atomic number

The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is what defines an element. The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number of the element. The periodic table sorts elements by their atomic number, which is usually written at the top of the element's case.

# Average atomic mass

Chemistry works on the atomic and sub-atomic scale, which provides us a better understanding of the ways of our universe and tools to alter its building blocks.

## Atomic mass unit (amu)

Historic unit of measure of the mass of an atom.

Unified atomic mass unit (u)

Modern version of amu. It is defined as $1.660540\times10^{-27}kg$. Yes, 27th power. 

The value $1.660540$ my seem arbitrary and, in a sense, it is. It was chosen because it's a "close enough" approximation of the mass of both a proton (tad heavier) and a neutron (tab lighter). Electrons are 2000 times less then $u$. This means that the mass of an atom is mostly defined by its protons and neutrons.

The unit "Da" stands for "Dalton" and can sometimes be used in stead of $u$.

## Isotopes

Elements can come in different "versions". For example, hydrogen $\ce{H}$ is mostly found in the universe as ${\ce{^1_1H}}$, meaning it has 1 proton and 0 neutron. There are variation of this element, with different numbers of neutrons. These different versions are called "isotopes".

### Isotopes naming convention

Isotopes are named using the name of the element, a hyphen and the atomic mass.

For example, hydrogen-2 ($\ce{^2H}$) is the element of hydrogen with an atomic mass of two. Because hydrogen has an the atomic number 1, meaning one proton, the isotope $\ce{^2H}$ has one added neutron.

In a periodic table, the average atomic mass denoted under the name of the element is the weighed atomic mass of the element using its natural proportion of occurrence in the universe as a coefficient. In older textbooks this used to be called "atomic weigh".

# Atomic weight calculation

Carbon-12 is the most common carbon isotope on earth at 98.89% with an atomic mass of 12amu and carbon-13 represents 1.110% with an atomic mass of 1.0034amu

![atomicWeight](C:\Repositories\Courses\Chemistry\Img\atomicWeight.PNG)

To obtain this result, we calculate the weighed average atomic mass of the carbon element as follows:
$$
\begin{align*}
12.01 &= 98.89\% \times \ce{^12C} + 1.110 \% \times\ce{^13C} \\
&= 0.9889 \times 12 + 0.0111 \times 13.0034 \\
&= 11.8668 + 0.14433774 \\
12.01 &\approx 12.01113774
\end{align*}
$$

# Mole and Avogadro's number

To go from atomic scale masses to "regular" scales

## Avogadro's number

Named after the early 19th century Italian chemist Amedeo Avogadro.

Avogadro's number is the number of atoms of a given element that are need to have its atomic number in grams.

eg. A one mole sample of lithium with atomic mass 6.94 Da is made of exactly $6.02214076\times10^{23}$ atoms of lithium, giving it a mass of 6.94g.

Avogadro's number is often approximated to $6.022\times10^23$.

## Mole

In chemistry, a mole of  "something" simply represents as many of these things as the Avogadro's number. That is 1 mol $= 6.02214076\times10^{23}$.

## Exercise: How many atoms of germanium in 15.4mg sample

Considering the fact that Germanium has a mean atomic mass of 69.723 Daltons we know that a mole of germanium will be 69.723 grams. $x$ is the number of atoms of germanium in the sample
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{1.54}{\times10^2}\mathrm{g} &= 15.4\mathrm{mg}/1000 \\
\frac{1\mathrm{mol}}{x\mathrm{mol}} &= \frac{69.723}{0.0154} \\
\frac{1\mathrm{mol}}{x\mathrm{mol}} &\approx 4527 \\
\frac{1\mathrm{mol}}{\frac{1}{4527}\mathrm{mol}} &= 0.0154 \\
x &= \frac{6.02214076\times10^{23}}{4527} \\
x &\approx \mathrm{1.33}{ × 10^{20}}
\end{align*}
$$
Thus $x \approx \mathrm{1.33}{ × 10^{20}}$



## Atomic number, mass number and isotopes

*Atomic number* $\mathrm{Z}$: The number of protons in a nucleus and the number of electrons **in a neutral atom**

*isotopes*: atoms of a single element that differ in the number of neutrons in their nuclei.

 ### Isotopes of hydrogen

## Notation of the identity of an isotope

$$
\ce{^A_ZS^{e}}
$$

Where 

- $\ce{S}$ is the symbol for the isotope (sufur in this case)
- $\ce{A}$ is the atomic mass of the isotope
- Z is the number of protons
- e is the electric charge

so $\ce{^32_16S^{2-}}$ Is an isotope of soflur with 16 protons and 26 neutrons that is negatively charged because it has 2 extra electrons. An isotope with a different number of electrons than it number of protons is called an "ion".
