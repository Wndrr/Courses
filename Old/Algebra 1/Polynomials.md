# Polynomial

From the greek Poly, for "many", and nominal, for "name". In mathematic this refers to "terms".

Example of polynomial. All of the following can be considered to be polynomials
$$
10x^7 - 9x^2 + 15x^3 + 9
$$
and
$$
9x^2 - 5
$$

$$
6
$$

$$
7y^2 - 3y + \pi
$$

Example that are not polynomials

If we replaced the power of $^7$ on $x$ in the first example with a negative power $^{-7}$  such that the equation becomes

$10x{^-7} - 9x^2 + 15x^3 + 9$

The rule is that for something to be a polynomials, the powers on variables of each of the terms must be non-negative.



## What's a polynomial

A polynomial is something made up of the sum of terms. The first example has 4 terms. Each of these terms have to be composed of a coefficient. For example, in the first term $10x^7$ the coefficient is $10$.

Generally, the form of a a term within a polynomial is the product of a coefficient $A$ with a variable $x$ raised to a positive integer power $n$: $Ax^n$.

### Names

There are specialized names depending on the number of terms present in a polynomial. For exemple:

- $10x^7$ has only one term, making it a *monomial*
- $10x^7 + -9x^2$ has two terms, making it a *binomial*
- three terms, trinomial
- *etc* 

### Degree

For a given term, the degree is the power to wich it is raised. For example in the following binomial $9x^2 - 5$ the first term has a degree of two, because it is raised to the power of two and the second term has a constant degree.

Polynomial degreed are spoken in cardinal numbers. Thus the above example is a second degree binomial.

The degree of an entire polynomial is the the degree of its term with the highest degree. $10x^7 - 9x^2 + 15x^3 + 9$ is a 7th degree polynomial.

### Leading term & coefficient

The leading term or coefficient is the term with the highest degree. When polynomials are written in standard form, the leading term/coefficient is always the first term.

#### Standard form

Is when you right the polynomial in order of descending degree. The polynomial $10x^7 - 9x^2 + 15x^3 + 9$ is not in standard for because its terms are not ordered by descending degree. The same polynomial in standard form would be $10x^7+ 15x^3 - 9x^2  + 9$.

## Multiplying monomials by polynomials

To multiply the trinomial $3x^2 -x + 2$ by $5$, we we multiply all the terms by $5$, that is, we distribute $5 * (3x^2 -x + 2)$
$$
\begin{align*}
&= 5 (3x^2 -x + 2) \\
&= (5*x^2) + (5 * (-x)) + (5 * 2))\\
&= 15x^2 - 5x + 10
\end{align*}
$$
Other example: Multiply the polynomial $3x + 4$ with $2x$ 
$$
\begin{align*}
&= 2x (3x + 4) \\
&= (2x * 3x) + (2x * 4) \\
&= 6x^2 + 8x
\end{align*}
$$

## Multiplying binomials

For binomial multiplication, we distribute again. 
$$
\begin{align*}
&= (x+2)(x + 3 ) \\
&= x^2 + 3x + 2x + 2*3 \\
&= x^2 + 6x + 6
\end{align*}
$$
In this case we end-up with a trinomial.

note: this trinomial is written in standard quadratic form. That means a a coefficient $A$ on the first degree term, some coefficient $B$ on the second degree term and a constant term C
$$
Ax^2 + Bx + C
$$
Let's express the binomial multiplication $(x - 4)(x + 7)$ into standard quadratic form
$$
\begin{align*}
&= (x - 4)(x + 7) \\
&= (x*x) + 7x +(x * (-4)) + (-4*7) \\
&= x^2 + 7x - 4x + -28 \\
&= x^2 + 3x -28
\end{align*}
$$
