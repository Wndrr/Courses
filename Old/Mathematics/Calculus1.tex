\section{Derivatives}

\subsection{Derivative as a concept}

The derivative of a line describes the rate of change of the vertical
component with respect to the horizontal component. The derivative
will allow us to calculate not the slope, but the instantaneous rate
of change at a given point. The derivative will give us the rate of
change at a given point that will be give us the slope of the tangent
line at that point. The reverse is true as well.

\subsection{Calculating the derivative}

Considering that the $\Delta y$ between two points is the result
of subtracting the $y$ component defined as $f(x)$ from the $y$
component of a second point that can be written as $f(x+\Delta x)$,
can be defined $\Delta y$ as $f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)$. Thus, formula
to find the derivative of a function $f(x)$ is

$$
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}
$$


Assuming a function $f(x)=x^{2}$ we can calculate the derivative
as follows

\begin{align*}
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} &= \frac{f(x+\Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x} \\
&= \frac{x^2 + 2x\Delta x+(\Delta x)^2)-x^2}{\Delta x}\\
&= \frac{2x\Delta x+(\Delta x)^2}{\Delta x}\\
&= 2x + \Delta x \\
\end{align*}	

The equation $2x + \Delta x$ gives us the derivative of the function $f(x)$ when $\Delta x$ heads towards zero, which would result in $2x + 0 = 2x$

In other words, the slope a $x$ for $f(x) = x^2$ is $2x$

"$\Deltax$ heads towards $0$" is written $dx$ and "the derivative of" is commonly written $\frac{d}{dx}$.
eg. $\frac{d}{dx}x^2=2x$
